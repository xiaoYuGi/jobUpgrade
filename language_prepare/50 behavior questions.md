The most significant skill while you want to find a job in a developed country seems to be language, of course provided that your professional skills have met the market requirements. As most of developed contries concentrated in Europe and North America. So English is the first skill I need to improve.

But for non-native english speakers, most english leanring scenarios focus on preparing for exams in the school, which may not be very useful when I need to communicate in a english-speaking environment.As a result,I often feel that my Enlish level is not sufficiant.

So what's the most effective way to improve English level quickly? 

To improve my English, I aim to communicate with native speakers more and more on topics that I am interested in, including questions that may be asked during an interview. 

So there are two issues i need to solve: finding a native speaker who can talk to me any time i need,and determing the topics to discuss.

For the first issue I hava found a great solution,which is a AI chatbot with text or voice.I highly recommened checking out https://deepenglish.com/aichatbot/.It's a free chatbot based on GPT-3.5.

The second issue can alson be solved by the first solution.Here are 35 behavior questions may be asked in a job interview,which i ontained throgh a conversation with the chatbot.I asked it to simulate a job interview,with me playing the role of the applicant and the chatbot acting as the interviewer.We will discuss each question within the scenario we simulated.

I wil keep a record of the conversations I have with the chatbot every day,focusing on one question per day.
